import { Heading } from '@lib/elements/Heading';

`Heading` components are used to generate titles that describe the page content and/or sections of it.
They rank in order of importance, from H1 to H6, with H1s usually being the main title.
Heading elements improve the readability and SEO of a webpage.

## Usage
```jsx
import { Heading } from '@dodo/ui/elements';

<Heading>h1 Heading</Heading>
```

By default a Heading element will render as a `h2` element since `h1` is usually reserved for the main title of the page.


## Examples
Pass in number 1 - 6 in the `level` variable to adjust the semantic level of the heading:

<div class="not-content">
	<Heading level={1}>Heading h1</Heading>
	<Heading level={2}>Heading h2</Heading>
	<Heading level={3}>Heading h3</Heading>
	<Heading level={4}>Heading h4</Heading>
	<Heading level={5}>Heading h5</Heading>
	<Heading level={6}>Heading h6</Heading>
</div>

```jsx
<Heading level={1}>This is a h1 heading</Heading>
```

## Visual style

You can also pass the `styledAs` variable to style the `Heading` to different heading sizes but keep the semantic level:

<div class="not-content">
	<Heading level={1} styledAs={6}>Heading h1 styled as h6</Heading>
</div>

```jsx
<Heading level={1} styledAs={6}>Heading h1 styled as h6</Heading>
```

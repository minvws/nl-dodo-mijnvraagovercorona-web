# Mijn Vraag Over Corona

This is a [Astro](https://astro.build) project.

## Getting Started

We're using NPM workspaces for our `cms` & `mvoc` packages.
First you'll need to install the dependencies:

```bash
# Install Dependencies
npm i
```

Then you can run/build the `mvoc` website:

```bash
# Run mvoc website locally
npm run mvoc:dev

# Build mvoc website
npm run mvoc:build

# Test mvoc website
npm run mvoc:test
```

**Note**: If you want to enable search in your dev environment you need to run `npm run mvoc:build` prior to running `npm run mvoc:dev`.

For the `cms` package you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Run Sanity cms locally
npm run cms:dev

# Deploy Sanity cms
npm run cms:deploy
```

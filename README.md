# Mijn Vraag Over Corona

This is a [Astro](https://astro.build) project.

## Getting Started

We're using Yarn workspaces for our `cms` & `mvoc` packages.
First you'll need to install the dependencies:

```bash
# Install Dependencies
yarn
```

Then you can run/build the `mvoc` website:

```bash
# Run mvoc website locally
yarn mvoc:dev

# Build mvoc website
yarn mvoc:build

# Test mvoc website
yarn mvoc:test
```

For the `cms` package you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Run Sanity cms locally
yarn cms:dev

# Deploy Sanity cms
yarn cms:deploy
```
